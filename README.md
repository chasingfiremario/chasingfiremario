I'm an engineer-programmer deeply passionate about crafting open-source technologies. My motto is to build tools that make learning and development more accessible. I tackle challenges related to enhancing user interfaces through ReactJS, crafting efficient APIs using GraphQL, and developing robust applications based on the Jam stack. My work is geared towards improving education and supporting communities, leveraging technology as a catalyst for change.
